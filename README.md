# 🔐 Python Port Scanner

An efficient *Port Scanner* built using Python, designed for basic network reconnaissance and educational cybersecurity practice.


📌 Project Overview

This tool scans a specified IP address across a defined range of ports to identify open TCP ports. It is a beginner-friendly project created to demonstrate the fundamentals of socket programming and port-level scanning.


⚙ Features

- ✅ User input for target IP and port range
- ✅ scans port from 1 to 1024
- ✅ Identifies open ports with quick socket connections
- ✅ Clean and minimal command-line interface
- ✅ Built using python's socket library



🛠 Technologies Used

- *Python 3.x*
- socket – For handling network connections
- sys – To manage system-level operations



🚀 How to Use

1. *Clone the repository*:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/muthu-23/port-scanner.git
   cd port-scanner



📷 Example Output

PS C:\Users\karth\OneDrive\Desktop\cyber projects> python port_scanner.py

Enter target IP address: 127.0.0.1

Port 135 is OPEN

Port 445 is OPEN
